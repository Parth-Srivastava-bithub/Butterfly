# Bitfy CLI: Your AI-Powered Command-Line Assistant

Bitfy CLI is a powerful and intelligent command-line interface assistant designed to streamline your workflow on Windows. It goes beyond simple automation by understanding your requests in natural language and intelligently deciding whether to provide a direct answer or execute a command on your behalf. Powered by the Groq API and a local vector store, Bitfy learns from every interaction, becoming more helpful and personalized over time.

## ‚ú® Features

  * **Natural Language to Command Execution:** Simply ask Bitfy to do something, and it will generate and propose the appropriate Windows command for you.
  * **Persistent Memory:** Bitfy remembers past conversations using a local FAISS vector store, allowing it to provide contextually aware and accurate responses based on your history.
  * **Performance-Optimized:** Asynchronous threading ensures that the memory update process doesn't slow down your command-line interactions.
  * **Interactive Confirmation:** For your safety, Bitfy will always ask for your explicit permission before executing any command.
  * **Effortless Setup:** Get started quickly by just setting your Groq API key via a simple command.

## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites

  * **Python 3.x:** Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
  * **pip:** Python's package installer, which comes with Python.

### Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/bitfy-cli.git
    cd bitfy-cli
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    *(Note: The dependencies are based on the code provided, including `click`, `pyfiglet`, `langchain`, `langchain-groq`, `langchain-huggingface`, `faiss-cpu`, and `sentence-transformers`.)*

## üìù Usage

### üîë Set Your Groq API Key

Before you can use Bitfy, you need to set up your Groq API key.

```bash
python bitfy.py --setapi <YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY>
```

### üí¨ Ask a Question or Run a Command

Use the `--ask` flag to interact with the AI assistant. Bitfy will analyze your request and provide a response or a command to execute.

| Command | Example Use Case |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Get System Info** | `python bitfy.py --ask "what is my computer's IP address?"` |
| **Manage Processes** | `python bitfy.py --ask "list all running processes"` |
| **Navigate & Interact** | `python bitfy.py --ask "show me all the files in my current directory"` |
| **General Knowledge** | `python bitfy.py --ask "explain the difference between TCP and UDP"` |
| **Troubleshooting** | `python bitfy.py --ask "why is my internet slow?"` |

### üîÑ Reset Chat History

To clear all stored chat history and the vector-based memory, use the `--reset` flag.

```bash
python bitfy.py --reset
```

This will delete `bitfy_chat_history.json` and the `bitfy_faiss_index` directory, giving you a fresh start.

## üß† How It Works

Bitfy combines several technologies to deliver its functionality:

  * **Groq LLM:** The `ChatGroq` model processes your natural language query. Its system prompt guides it to identify when a command is needed and to wrap it in `<execute>` tags.
  * **FAISS Vector Store:** The `FAISS` library creates a vector-based index of your past conversations. This "memory" is used to retrieve relevant context for future queries, making the AI's responses more accurate over time.
  * **Hugging Face Embeddings:** The `sentence-transformers` model transforms your conversations into dense vector representations that can be stored and searched in the FAISS index.
  * **Python Subprocess:** The `subprocess` module is used to safely execute the commands generated by the LLM after you've confirmed them.
